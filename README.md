# DOSAttack-EthicalHacking-FP
This repository made in order to create a project that implementing the DOS attack using Scapy library in python and network tools called Hping3. 
Below is the detail information about the project and the contributors.


## Project Details
Scapy is a Python library that enables us to send, sniff, and dissect network frames (Rosenbaum, 2022). We use the Scapy library to make 
a function that will send packets in a loop until the attacker stop it. This will makes the server unaware of the attack and responds to 
each attempt with a SYN-ACK packet from each port. In this way, the server will quickly be unresponsive to legitimate clients. Other than
that, we also use Hping3 tools to perform the DOS attack.
